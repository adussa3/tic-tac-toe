            We don't have to put everything in a component! We can also put elements inside of index.html
            if it doesn't need to be reused to re-rendered each time (it doesn't use state or props! - it's static)
        -->
        <!--
            We can also directly reference images in the public folder!
            We don't need to add a path to public, like "pubic/game-logo.png"

            NOTE:
            You should use the public/ folder for any images that should not be handled by the build process and that
            should be generally available. Good candidates are images used directly in the index.html file or favicons.

            On the other hand, images that are used inside of components should typically be stored in the src/ folder (e.g., in src/assets/).
